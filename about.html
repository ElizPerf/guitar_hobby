<h2>Who am I</h2>
<p>I'm not a professional player! I've learned to play guitar by myself for years and still learn.</p>
<p>Nowadays I don't have time for that, but when I take the guitar into my arms I can't stop playing! It's almost impossible. Depend on my mood I play some classical pieces or even rock riffs...</p>
<p>I also like singing with guitar playing, so it especially makes my day!</p>
